# RockPaperScissorsAI
A program that plays the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors against a human — but instead of picking randomly, it tries to “predict” user moves and beat the user more intelligently.

Requirements:
1. User able to randomly picks Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
2. App tracks the player’s past moves (3 times) and assumes they’ll repeat.
3. App counters with user’s most frequent move.
